# Commuz

Showcase of Centrale Lyon and EM's Commuz

Project is already built:

To run the frontend simply go to the frontend project folder Commuz>Commuz (twice, the second Commuz is the frontend for the project)

Now simply install serve if you don't have it already and run the build project

```rb
npm install -g serve
serve -s dist
```

That's it!

The backend is harder to run and requires an openAI key, the backend is only necessary for MisterCommuz and will not be explained here.
